# Openwhisk Bundle

Allow your Symfony 4 application to run within an Openwhisk function. This bundle (including [its Symfony Recipe](https://github.com/symfony/recipes-contrib/tree/master/sroze/openwhisk-bundle/0.2)) will give your an Openwhisk front-controller for your Symfony application.

## Usage

*Warning:* As this is still in development, this might not be working as expected on your project.

```
composer req sroze/openwhisk-bundle
```
